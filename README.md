A comprehensive, user-centric **web-based health & fitness tracking application** developed as part of an MCA university Agile project. The system helps users monitor and improve their overall wellness through four integrated modules: **Fitness**, **Diet**, **Progress**, and **Profile**.

Built with a focus on simplicity, responsiveness, and real-time user interaction using modern web technologies and Agile methodology.

## 📋 Project Overview

The **Smart Fitness Tracking System** is designed to provide a 360° view of personal health by combining exercise tracking, nutrition logging, visual progress analytics, and personalized user profiles. It serves as an all-in-one companion for students, fitness enthusiasts, and anyone pursuing sustainable lifestyle changes.

### Core Modules
- **Fitness Module** — Log workouts (strength, cardio, flexibility), track activity (duration, reps, calories burned), view daily summaries.
- **Diet Module** — Record meals, track calories/macros/nutrients, get basic intake insights.
- **Progress Module** — Visualize trends with charts, milestones, streaks, before-after metrics, and motivational stats.
- **Profile Module** — Manage personal info, set/customize goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain), sync preferences, and view health overview.

### Key Features
- Intuitive and responsive UI (mobile-first design)
- LocalStorage-based data persistence (no backend required for MVP)
- Real-time workout/meal logging and instant stats updates
- Simple navigation between modules
- Future-ready for enhancements (API integrations, charts, authentication)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (custom responsive styling), Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Storage**: Browser LocalStorage (for workouts, diet logs, progress data)
- **Development Methodology**: Agile (sprints, user stories, iterative MVP releases, continuous feedback)
- **Tools**: VS Code, Git, GitHub
- **Planned/Optional**: Chart.js (for progress graphs), Bootstrap/Tailwind (UI polish), Firebase/Local backend (future)
